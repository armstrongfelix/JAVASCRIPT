/* JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPES

    Data types
A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.

There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. Here, we’ll cover them in general and in the next chapters we’ll talk about each of them in detail.

We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a number:

primitive data types (stores on value at a time)
    number
    string
    boolean
    null
    undefined
    big int
non primitve data types (hold collection of values or poperty:value pairs)
    symbol
    array
    object
