FUCNTIONS OF THE CONSOLE.LOG STATEMENT

    1. Display Output to the Console

    console.log() prints messages or values to the browser’s developer console.
    This is especially useful when you want to see the result of a calculation or check what your code is doing.

    console.log("Hello, world!");

    2. Debugging Code

    It helps developers identify bugs by showing variable values at different points in a program.

    let x = 5;
    console.log("Value of x is:", x);

    3. Track Code Execution

    You can use it to mark code execution points and see which parts of your program are running.

    console.log("Loop started");

    4. Display Objects, Arrays, and Data Structures

    console.log() can show complex data structures clearly.

    console.log({name: "John", age: 25});
    console.log([1, 2, 3, 4]);

    5. Test Expressions Quickly

    You can evaluate expressions without storing them in variables.

    console.log(5 + 10 * 2);

    6. Provide Information to Developers

    It acts as an in-code message board for developers working on the same project.

    console.log("Fetching user data...");
